# Twitch Interactive Timer Overlay
I needed a timer where user could add or remove time by using commands

I also wanted to integrate points users can collect while watching the stream. Either trough a bot or the Twitch channel points.

The outcome is this overlay, you can use and configure however you like.

This overlay is only possible thanks to [ComfyJS](https://github.com/instafluff/ComfyJS) made by [@Instafluff](https://github.com/instafluff)

The default font used is [OpenDyslexic](https://www.opendyslexic.org/) and was choosen to be more inclusive by improving readability & accessibility

## Setup ##
1. Download all the files and extract them somewhere on your PC

2. Open the ``config.js`` with an text editor (Notepad++ is recommended)

   1. Replace Schkullie with your own Twitch-username (don't delete the "" or it will not work)

   2. Edit all the other parameters to your liking

   3. (If you want to change the Font, open ``timer.css`` in an editor and replace ``OpenDyslexic`` after the second ``font-family:`` with the name of your prefered Google font) (don't delete the '' or it will not work)

3. Add the ``timer.html`` as a browser source to OBS and make sure to enable the last option "refresh browser when scene becomes active" to avoid any problems in the future
